# Moonshot

## Configuration

The app configuration lies in `config/application.yml` and is **not**
versionned by git (for security reasons). If you've just cloned this
repo, ask a colleague for his `application.yml` file over a secure channel.

## Team

The team behind this app is rag tag team of international high-school dropouts whose previous attempts to conquer the Earth failed. But here they go again, with a fierce appetite for destruction.
